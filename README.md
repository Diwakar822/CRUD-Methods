## Features

- **Create**: Add new entries to the database.

==> API Endpoints
This project interacts with the following mock API endpoints (replace with your actual endpoints):

GET: https://mocki.io/v1/your-get-endpoint - Retrieve all items.
POST: https://mocki.io/v1/your-post-endpoint - Create a new item.
PUT: https://mocki.io/v1/your-put-endpoint/:id - Update an existing item.
DELETE: https://mocki.io/v1/your-delete-endpoint/:id - Delete an item by ID.
Testing with Postman
You can use Postman to test the API endpoints independently of the application. Hereâ€™s how:

==> Open Postman.

Use the provided endpoints to test each CRUD operation:
For GET, select GET method and enter the GET endpoint.
For POST, select POST method, set the body to JSON, and enter your data.
For PUT, select PUT method, enter the ID in the URL, and update the body.
For DELETE, select DELETE method and enter the ID in the URL.
